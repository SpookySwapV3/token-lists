# How to submit your token(s) to our token list

## Step 1
Fork this repository. If you have an existing fork from before, pull and merge upstream changes.

## Step 2
 In your fork add your token(s) and then raise by 1 the "major" version number at the start of the json file. Add token logos to the repo if you do not have them hosted at an external location, and add the logo link to your json entries by following the existing examples.

## Step 3
Create a PR from your fork to our original repo. Make sure to enable the option **"Allow edits by maintainers" while putting up the PR.**

### Notes:
All of the necessary steps can also be done through the GitHub Web UI.
If you are a Spooky team member, you can create PRs directly on this repository (by making a new branch), instead of having to fork it.
